I'm working on plenty of stuff at all times, I have a hungry mind and I need to keep my brain occupied.

Some of the things I'm currently working on;

* [PodcastIndex.org](https://podcastindex.org/) where I run web spiders to discover new podcast feeds, I've added more than 3.5 Million feeds this far.
  * Mapping of languages, all of ISO-639 (ISO-639-1, ISO-639-2B, ISO-639-2T and ISO-639-3) minus sign languages which does not make much sense in regards of audio/video podcasts - not yet active.
  * Self-contained OPML-Editor, with Import/Export functionality with PodcastIndex as search backend. (PHP)
  * Podcast feed validation rules (RegExp).
  * Podcast namespace collection - there is many namespaces, but PodcastIndex have a namespace to rule them all.
  * Podcast search with PI as backend for Sonos devices, Kodi .. nothing working at the moment.
* Swedish Swish 123-numbers directory for companies and associations
* WMI-directory - World Manufacturer Identifiers, the first 3-6 characters of VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) codes.
* Home Assistant
  * Small hacks to bring in AQI (Air Quality Index) measurements to HA



... and plenty more. Only the current ones listed above.



I'm learning new stuff;

* Python, which I use daily
