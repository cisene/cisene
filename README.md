### Christopher Isene



I'm working on plenty of stuff at all times, I have a hungry mind and I need to keep my brain occupied.

Some of the things I'm currently working on;

* [PodcastIndex.org](https://podcastindex.org/):
  * I run web spiders to discover new podcast feeds
  * I've added more than 3.5 Million feeds this far.
  * Mapping of languages, all of ISO-639 (ISO-639-1, ISO-639-2B, ISO-639-2T and ISO-639-3) minus sign languages which does not make much sense in regards of audio/video podcasts - not yet active.
  * Self-contained OPML-Editor, with Import/Export functionality with PodcastIndex as search backend. (PHP)
  * OPML collections nightly, [https://b19.se/data/](https://b19.se/data/)
  * Podcast [feed validation rules](https://github.com/cisene/podcast-map) through use of Regular Expressions, regex for short. This is to be able to map, deduce if a feed URL looks valid before even ingesting or verifying.
    * 405 Toplevel domains covered.
    * Almost 75000 domains.
    * Over 100000 rules/patterns.
    * Available in XML and JSON-flavoured files.
  * Podcast [namespace collection](https://gist.github.com/cisene/cf67d4fc9d4d4dc892630cac4a3adcb0) - there is many namespaces, but PodcastIndex have a [namespace](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace) to rule them all.
  * Podcast search with PI as backend for
    * Sonos devices
    * Kodi and mediacenter devices
* Swedish Swish 123-numbers [directory](https://github.com/cisene/swish-123) for companies and associations
  * [Swish-Katalogen](https://github.com/cisene/swish-katalogen) - A simple search engine for data from the Swish 123-numbers - online: [Swish-Katalogen](https://b19.se/swish-katalogen/)
  * [Swish-roulette](https://github.com/cisene/swish-roulette) - An attempt to gamify donations by using data from the Swish 123-numbers - soon online.
* WMI-directory - World Manufacturer Identifiers, the first 3-6 characters of VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) codes.
  * [Libre-WMI](https://github.com/cisene/libre-wmi) - WMI-data in simple forms, XML, YAML and JSON.
* Home Assistant
  * Small hacks to bring in AQI (Air Quality Index) measurements to HA
* Useful datasets, my attempts at fixing the world; [Data Available](https://github.com/cisene/data-available)
  * Shoe sizes in millimeter, EU and US [shoe-sizes](https://github.com/cisene/data-available/blob/master/INT/shoe-sizes.yaml)


... and plenty more. Only the current ones listed above.



If I had more free time on my hands (whatever is left after spending a good chunk of it with family), I'd like to explore a few things;

* More crypto-stuff (not crypto currencies and such, real crypto as in cryptography)



I'm learning new stuff;

* Python, which I use daily
* Rust, on and off .. never get the time.
* Hive
