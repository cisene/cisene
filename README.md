# Christopher Isene



I'm working on plenty of stuff at all times, I have a hungry mind and I need to keep my brain occupied.

## Some of the things I'm currently working on;

* Restoration of [Daily Source Code Podcast](https://github.com/cisene/daily-source-code-podcast) RSS feed
  * Archeological diggings and finds, Adam Curry's experimental [iPod](https://github.com/cisene/daily-source-code-podcast/tree/main/iPod) script.

* [SE-POI](https://github.com/cisene/se-poi) Swedish POI, Points-of-Interest .. as to scratch an itch for another project.
  * [Svenskt Hålindex](https://github.com/cisene/svenskt-halindex) - Swedish: "Ett unikt sätt att klassificera svenska hålor".

* [PodcastIndex.org](https://podcastindex.org/):
  * I run web spiders to discover new podcast feeds
  * I've added more than 3.5 Million feeds this far.
  * Mapping of languages, all of ISO-639 (ISO-639-1, ISO-639-2B, ISO-639-2T and ISO-639-3) minus sign languages which does not make much sense in regards of audio/video podcasts - not yet active.
  * Self-contained OPML-Editor, with Import/Export functionality with PodcastIndex as search backend. (PHP)
  * OPML collections nightly, [https://b19.se/data/](https://b19.se/data/)
  * Podcast [feed validation rules](https://github.com/cisene/podcast-map) through use of Regular Expressions, regex for short. This is to be able to map, deduce if a feed URL looks valid before even ingesting or verifying.
    * 405 Toplevel domains covered.
    * Almost 75000 domains.
    * Over 100000 rules/patterns.
    * Available in XML and JSON-flavoured files.
  * Podcast [namespace collection](https://gist.github.com/cisene/cf67d4fc9d4d4dc892630cac4a3adcb0) - there is many namespaces, but PodcastIndex have a [namespace](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace) to rule them all.
  * Podcast search with PI as backend for
    * Sonos devices
    * Kodi and mediacenter devices
* Swedish [Swish 123-numbers](https://github.com/cisene/swish-123) directory for companies and associations
  * [Swish-Katalogen](https://github.com/cisene/swish-katalogen) - A simple search engine for data from the Swish 123-numbers - online: [Swish-Katalogen](https://b19.se/swish-katalogen/)
* Useful datasets, my attempts at fixing the world; [Data Available](https://github.com/cisene/data-available)
  * Shoe sizes in millimeter, JP, EU, CN and US [shoe-sizes](https://github.com/cisene/data-available/blob/master/INT/shoe-sizes.yaml)


... and plenty more. Only the current ones listed above.



As you may have notices, many of the project are about data and information, not so much about code.

Well arranged data is useful information.



If I had more free time on my hands (whatever is left after spending a good chunk of it with family), I'd like to explore a few things;

* More crypto-stuff (not crypto currencies and such, real crypto as in cryptography)



I'm learning new stuff;

* Python, which I use daily
* Rust, on and off .. never get the time.
* Hive
