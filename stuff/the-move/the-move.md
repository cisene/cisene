# The Move - How NOT to move between two dwellings

I used to work in Stockholm but since our son was born in 2013, I decided to shift gears and work closer to home, I found employment with a really good company in Västerås doing system integrations, where I started in April 2014, in the autumn of 2014 we felt that nothing really kept us back in Eskilstuna and it would be much more convenient to move to Västerås, closer to work, so at some occasion we briefly touched on the subject while having some friends over and they (also a small family of three, one daughter) were interested in buying the house, we took inventory of the house and drafted up some papers and sold without a realtor or real estate agent (big mistake) in between and carried on with finding an apartment in Västerås.

We bid on several apartments but did not win, until we bid on an apartment we only had seen pictures of .. and won with our last possible bid. Later on we met up with the seller and looked at what we had bought, it was just as nice as we had seen in the pictures. There were some technicalities with signing papers and transfer ownership and somewhere along the line, our buyers misunderstood or jumped the gate, they terminated their apartment lease before they got a definite date from us, even after we had explicitly asked them to just wait.

Somehow, we managed to register ourselves on our new address while the seller still lived there, to be able to enroll our son for daycare and put him in queue for schools and such, also managed to get the ISP (for Internet and IP-TV) to accept us as customers and send out hardware before we officially had moved in to make the gap between subscriptions as small and short as possible.



TLDR; *Due to technicalities we were forced out of our house, we had sold our little house to a couple of friends (no longer) that were a bit too trigger happy, had terminated their rental lease two months early, resulting in that they had to move in early and they forced us out and we had to endure two months without housing.*

NEVER EVER TRUST A NON-WRITTEN AGREEMENT. NEVER SELL OR BUY ANYTHING FROM FRIENDS.



Some explanations;

**Home Base B19** - Our little house in Hällbybrunn, Eskiistuna

**Habitat L** - A small basement apartment on Lundbladsvägen, Eskilstuna

**Habitat X** - A hotel in central Västerås, Vasagatan

**Habitat B** - A bed and breakfast outside Västerås, Badelunda Bed & Breakfast

**FLV5** - Our destination, the aparment we moved to in Bjurhovda, Västerås



Everything below was posted on my now defunct blog, I wrote this blog posts to keep sane during the period when we were technically "homeless" or "unhoused". 





## We are leaving Home Base B19 (2015-07-30)

Yup! As there were some discussions about when we should move, we made the decision to leave. Early. A whole month early. As we had been aiming to leave the house in the end of august .. but it became end of july, because reasons.

So, we're entering a nomadic lifestyle for the next two months, first to "Habitat L" which is in Eskilstuna, as our son still has daycare close to previous home base. HabL is located just about across Eskilstuna (along the same bus lane) and will require some travelling when dropping off and fetching the son at daycare, but it is by bus and our son loves buses. Later on we will move to a yet unknown location in Västerås, as we are still finalizing the details and negotiating terms and contracts we really do not know where we will end up during September, but as it is about a month away, we have some time to straighten out some question marks.

Tomorrow we are going to move most of our belongings to storage, everything that previously were spread over 5 rooms and 119 square meters, is now boxed up and ready (almost) to be transported to storage. We reduced the amount of things pretty hard, everything we hadn't used during the last 6 months were a candidate for elimination, many things were tossed/discarded as we has dupes and for some other reasons. We are up to about 30 boxes and a few big items, like shelves and beds as well as our home office desk.

Friday we have a catch-up round, stuff that was needed during the night between thursday and friday will be gathered and transported to storage, in the evening of friday we will pick up the keys to HabL and install ourselves into our temporary home, all 40 square meters of it.

I will try to post more and often, during our nomadic period.



## First day at Habitat L (2015-08-01)

Last night we arrived to Habitat L, tired and bruised from carrying boxes and trash. We pretty much defragmented and compressed our belongings from 120 square meters into 12 square meters, the 12 square meters are the storage unit we rented to hold our stuff until we can move in at the new Home base FLV5.

HabL is about 40 square meters, furniture, kitchen, couch and a small TV, enough to get by for a month. Nothing fancy, just somewhere to sleep pretty much.

Handed over keys for Home base B19 to new owners today, took a few hours before first call, as expected .. complaints about the cleaning, but I told them they got a very good deal for the house, we met their demand for earlier (than originally negotiated) access and we even told them that we would just do light cleaning as in sweeping floors and do bathroom and toilets, as they said that they would do renovation.

Yesterday we went to trash everything that didn't made it in the runs for the storage unit, two runs for storage unit and two to the junkyard, I trashed lots of things I'd like to keep but we had no time or place for the things. Slight helplessness and depression, valued belongings got tossed, feeling naked.

HabL is ok, but I already found a few thing I'm gonna suggest for the land lord to fix and/or adjust. Bathroom shower floor has the wrong slope, or lack of slope of the tile floor, newly renovated so it will probably not be fixed any time soon - a squeege to vacate the water on the floor after showering. The fridge is bubbling quite loudly and the fridge compressor is loud too. That is about it for now.

Tonight we also got notice from the potential habitat we scouted earlier, they got notice from land lords that they wanted to renovate the apartment while the family stays in the apartment, by that the window closes for us as we would sublet their apartment after they moved out where they would end up with double rent for a month.

Yet another potential habitat just backed out of negotiations, they wanted monthly rent + (2 * rent) for deposition (the total amount surpassed a regular persons monthly salary), informed them that deposition is sneaky and cheap as we rented an apartment without deposition but had a clause in the contract stipulating the rules for missing or broken inventory, that it should be replaced with equally or better items or financially restored.

Now we are hunting for alternatives as we will get final notice on Thursday about the first potential habitat, we need alternatives as this one seems slip out of our hands. Short term rental market are pretty small - we have asked around and got anything from 8500kr/month to 95000kr/month, so the span is pretty wide, and ranging from unfurnished rooms to rental flats and hotels. Professional rental flat company is asking for 14000kr/month for a regular flat with bunk beds as their budget option, doubling cost would give a regular flat, 28000kr/month.



## Hab L, Day 3 (2015-08-03)

First day back at work, felt good with a little structure again. Transports were a little wonky, colleague picked me up across town, to where I had traveled by bus - to avoid a 10 kilometer detour. Office network was wonky, just a slow crawl and some sites didn't load at all, VPN connectivity was non-existent.

Leaving and fetching son had been a breeze, we were not sure about if the daycare would actually be open today but they were and son enjoyed hanging out with his friends. Really tired little boy when I came home, applying food and a shower and put to bed. Slept within 10 minutes.

Found an RJ-45 jack in the hab, remembered I had stuffed a router in a backpack while packing our go-bags, connected it and got an IP .. but could not get any further. I do not know what kind of network it is, got 10.x.x.x which is private addresses for LAN, scanned for gateways and services and found a couple of routers. Got nothing.

Thinking about checking if neighbors has weak passwords .. or WPS enabled. Using the USB-cable to charge my headset at the moment but as soon as it is fully charged, I can use the cable to hook up the high powered WIFI dongle, to find out what's in the surroundings.

Continuing search for hab for September, as we are expecting the arrangement we had in our hands to go away. Found a few that were asking for fantasy prices, close to imaginary numbers, we still have a few to check out and new ones might show up as we go.

Wife made simple dinner, pasta with bits of bacon and cream sauce, nomz for the boy and nomz for the father, even got left overs for lunchbox.

Too early to say anything about life in the hab, as we only had a few days this far. Maybe we have made up our minds and formed opinions after a week or more, it's small and some things are a bit quirky but nothing really bad.



## Hab L, Day 4 (2015-08-04)

Another day at work, forgot lunch box and had the "misfortune" to go fetch sushi, the regular sushi place had changed owner and changed name from Sushi Queen to Sushi Heaven. Still good sushi. Yum.

Son was happy but tired when I came to the habitat, daycare really drains him of energy which is good, some days when we just hang out indoors for lack of good weather, we really need to go out, promenade or just visit the nearest play ground, to drain his energy. Put to bed he got quiet and fell a sleep within 10 minutes.

Funny thing of the day; I heard from former colleagues things about other former colleagues, without naming names and pointing fingers, karma is a bitch.

Still searching for habitat in Västerås for September, informed colleagues during lunch, none of them had anything but said they would check with families and friends, we have a few options but they aren't all that good, a long stay hotel with a fair rate for a month .. but with clientel, I'm not sure I want to expose my family to that, for me personally it would be a breeze, already set the low mark with stay at low budget hotel in Kaunas in Lithuania, anything with higher standard than that would be easy-peasy. Another one is a small cottage with a pantry, toilets and showers out in a small hut in the yard, the location is a bit off though, requires a 3 kilometer walk to catch the bus, which would be good sunny days .. but would be a pain in the ass rainy days. We are quite positive the problem will be solved by the time when we have to move to the next hab. I have even taken into account that we might need to stay at hotel for a few nights but longer than that would break the budget.



## Hab L, Day 5 (2015-08-05)

Work as usual, different route today. Nothing much to say about that.

Had some interesting discussions during lunch break with colleagues about companies surveillance of the internet, their information gathering from your online accounts and beacons, how a simple search for a particular item online resulted in advertising on Facebook. Also about hard disc recovery of crashed NAS discs.

The search for a September hab is still on, could use some luck in this area. Four lousy weeks, somewhere to sleep, for two adults and a baby. That is all I'm asking for. 



## Hab L, Day 7 (2015-08-07)

Nothing new other than that we got a definite notice yesterday, that we can not have the apartment we went to look at, the family were offered to stay for free while having it renovated by the land lord. We have only a few options left to explore.

Colleagues have suggested different options, going to explore them next week when people start returning from vacations, some of them might bare fruit some may not.

Went to IFTTT to check if they had a channel for Google+ and the possibility to have blog posts posted on G+ .. no such channel unfortunately. So I have to resort to manually cross posting blog posts. Otherwise I use the IFTTT service to automate some parts of life. IFTTT automagically posts new blog posts as tweets, teasing followers (and bots) to visit.



## Hab L, Day 8 (2015-08-08)

Woke up really early due to a jumpy little boy who woke up 06:20-ish. Changes diaper and fed him and put him back to bed, went back to bed and woke up again about 2 hours later, then eating breakfast and having a cup of coffee.

Lynn went to meet with new owners, they are collecting our mail as the redirect at the postal service hasn't kicked in yet, some bills but also some package notice, for someone with a similar name but the wrong address, gonna call the old neighbors to check if the know who it might be, don't know them so it might be one of their daughters boy friends or something, I don't remember ordering anything and aren't expecting any packages.

We walked into town and went to SKVF, Swedish Chinese- Vietnamese Association of Eskilstuna, I was full but Lynn and Marcus had some to eat, Duck soup and Beef soup, I went for a Vietnamese coffee. With some bellies filled with food and others with coffee, we went on to Asian shop for groceries and other necessities. Walked around for a while in town, as the Park Festival vendors had their stands with stuff of assorted kinds, let Marcus push the pram to burn off some of his energy, he screams and tries to fend off our hands when we try to steer the pram between people and becomes irritated with us as we are trying to avoid collisions.

Back at the hab we put Marcus to bed and started preparing dinner, let Marcus sleep for about an hour before waking him up, slightly groggy he gobbled down rice and and some meat while we had red curry beef with coconut sauce. Some post-dinner cuddle with his favorite videos before a short visit to the nearby playground were we played with the slide and swing set, went back to hab for a swift shower, a bottle of gruel, brushing teeth and nite-nite. Little boy were very tired and complained for a few minutes, left the room for a few minutes and he was sleeping when I looked.

The hab offers nothing much to do other than cooking and sleeping, we brought tablets and laptops to be able to work and play.

Saturday night, we're sitting hunched over a laptop each, I'm watching some movie with Russel Crowe and Lynn is doing some homework, English assessment or essay I think.



## Hab L, Day 12 (2015-08-12)

Got an SMS from the land lord asking if we could leave two days early, before end of contract, to humor the next tenant. With a promise that we would get money back for the two days. That creates even more of obstacles for us, as the next accommodation has not been completely specified and fixated yet, in fact we have been hunting down even the most vague and abstract kinds of accommodations in and around Västerås. We are most probably going to refuse to leave early, if by miracle a new and unknown accommodation would surface and it seems to be good and to our specifications, then maybe we could leave early.

Thought earlier today that I might get a few hours on the couch this evening to code a little, as I haven't written a line of code since we moved, my servers where code and databases reside are in storage and not available. But no. Have ideas I want to try.

I have been thinking about how and what I would need to get when getting decent broadband, 100/100Mbps but 250/250Mbps the first three months, could be used for; at least two TOR-relays made from Raspberry Pi's and possibly yet another two if the first two is not enough to run some internal services, worker clients for some jobs that needs some horse power. Otherwise I have two VPN boxes I want to set up and send one off to my brother, so we can have an open connection between our networks over the internet, including to have a few NAS boxes, my own and host my brothers and the same set up at his place, we would both have off-site storage but under each others control.



## Hab L, Day 14 (2015-08-14)

Yesterday it felt really good, after a call to a potential land lord. The place we are interested in is a old air force facility turned bed and breakfast. With 2-5 minutes walk to the bus in one direction and 10-15 minute walk to a bus in another direction. The land lord were to call back today with his calculations, we were promised half the regular price which puts it in the "budget-range", of course some things are stripped out to make our stay cheaper, like internet and breakfasts - which we will provide for ourselves. Another thing is the laundry machine, where we have to pay a smallish amount to use it each time.

Unfortunately he haven't called yet, the number I got is for a land line phone, so if he isn't around I won't be able to reach him, left a message on the answering machine.

The guy that is renting **Hab L** after us want us to leave early, as in two days early, called him yesterday to explain why we can not leave early, I think he got it but he was still interested, so if we find a place and we can leave early, he'd pay us for the remaining days. That would be peanuts, but I'm hoping we could get going early, more time to install ourselves in the new Hab and explore the surroundings and communications.

As we would live close to an aero plane museum, I think my father would be interested in seeing the planes, I've seen them once already and there is much fun there, flight simulators and a mix of civil and military airships, American, Swedish and Russian.

I think we have done about a quarter of this nomadic episode, 25% completion.



## Hab L, Day 16 (2015-08-16)

Today was kind of slow, walked to town and strolled around for a bit, picked up some items that we needed. Son is cranky with fever and tonight he was really hot, found a tub in the laundry room which we nicked (temporarily) and used to give him a batch to cool him off before going to bed. Warm and cosy water, I suddenly see bubbles .. and a gigantic turd. Pulled him out and fished out the turd, dumped the water and scrubbed the tub and rinsed it, refilled and put him back.

We have been discussing the options and opinions we have about the accommodations, each accommodation has its pros and cons. Some are quirky, others are cramped for space, the best we have found yet is the one we are currently at, **Hab L**, so at the moment we are thinking hard and long, hoping for something else to surface, or we have to settle with an accommodation that will just barely work.

We visited one potential accommodation yesterday, in Västerås, or to be more correct, the outskirts of Västerås. Really nice place and it would be a breeze to stay there, unless we had a child. Newly renovated and restored military barrack, with bunk beds and lots of military and civil aviation paraphernalia decorating the walls. Shoe line at the door and really nice common areas. We were looking for something with self-catering, with access to a kitchen for regular cooking, everything you'd expect when subletting a furnished apartment. No self-catering/kitchen access and bunk beds made it a non-alternative. Unfortunately.



## Hab L, Day 18 (2015-08-18)

Work was fun, did away with lots of incidents and closed low for the month. Good thing.

Son is a handful, when I came home he was cheerful and happy, about half an hour later he was crying for nothing, law of least resistance, dropped his blanket, cry, removed his shoes, cry. You get it.

We need to find somewhere to go, after next week we have nowhere to go unless we solve this problem. Worst case scenario is a professional rent-a-flat company which charges a foot and a leg per month, other than that we are left with two options, cramped bed and breakfast or a long-stay hotel with clientele.



## Hab L, Day 19 (2015-08-19)

Overslept this morning but were able to catch the train and arrive to the office in time. But needed coffee throughout the day, I think I had 6 or 8 cups .. or rather large mugs of coffee.

The accommodation situation hasn't changed much, thinking about dropping one of the alternatives, as it is cramped for space, estimated the bedroom to be less than 14 square meters and the rest of the cottage to be another 20 square meters at most. On top of that, bunk beds. Just no.

Called on an advert for rental of a house, nowhere it said it was for a full year, I explained what we were looking for and just maybe the lady had a friend who might help us by sub letting a 100 square meter apartment for a month - gonna call back tomorrow to find out if it is available.

I need to call to the other alternatives to make sure their offers are still on and check what kind of rooms and size we're gonna get.



## Hab L, Day 20 (2015-08-20)

Work was intense, weekly meeting over video conference system and Skype and research stuff to solve problems.

On my way to the train home, I took a little detour, to the hotel we were looking at for accommodation, checked availability and also checked the room, looked petty much ok. Told the guy I needed to discuss it with my wife, but already knew that at least one essential part was missing, a kitchen, no matter how small we need a kitchen, our budget does not cover eating out every day.

Called the lady I spoke to yesterday, the one with a friend who might have an apartment to sublet to us for a month, she said that the friend had promised someone else the apartment. The call ended after about half a minute.

We still have an alternative, our fallback alternative, a smallish apartment with a kitchenette, the bare minimum met. The downside is the price, it exceeds our accommodation budget and cuts a big chunk out of the food budget.

Next week we're going off site with the job, for conference. I'm not sure how to handle that yet, as I do not want to be away over night and I didn't pack any nice clothes, only regular work and every day clothes. I will probably just tag along for the day and go home by train in the evening and work at the office the day after.



## Hab L, Day 21 (2015-08-21)

Colleagues were surprised that we still hadn't found any accommodation yet during the break fast at the office. Spent pretty much half day in meetings, 3 before lunch.

Need to reevaluate the two alternatives we have now, need to decide and pick one of them, sign on.

Also need to continue the bank thingies to finalize the deal, final payment.

Need to empty a server of logs, before it clogs up.

Lots of needs-todo.

If this move-thingy doesn't gives me an few extra white hairs, nothing is.



## Hab L, Day 23 (2015-08-23)

Spent most of the day out at my parents place, BBQ and lots of talk. Son had a blast, running around naked and running through sprinkler and having a bath in a small tub in the garden.

Back at home/**Hab L**, we gave son a quick bath, fed him gruel and put to bed, he was sleeping within 5 minutes, really tired.

<strong>Update:</strong> Fuggtard! The shower wall in the bath room broke, the aluminum profile fractured at the lower hinge. Googled the fugg outta shower walls, it might set us back several thousands. Just what we didn't need.



## Hab L, Day 25 (2015-08-25)

Crazy day at the office, a whole months meeting quota in just two days and the week isn't even over yet.

The accommodation situation is looking bright, nailed down a few more details and have pretty much decided that this one is the one.

A smallish house in a Bed & Breakfast setting where we have two rooms, regular beds (aside from bunk beds) and access to bicycles (where one has a child saddle mounted on) and located just a few kilometers from the preschool/daycare center our son is attending.

One thing worries me a little, the shower wall door thingy, each door is about 3000 SEK and I don't know how to tell the land lord.

Another thing that worries me, but is just a speed bump on our way towards the destination is a slight gap between accommodations, two days where we have to find something completely else as the B&B place were fully booked. Probably we end up at some hotel, but we still don't know.





## Hab L, Day 27 (2015-08-27)

Was away on conference during the day, went home after all the days activities were done, all colleagues were staying and have a really interesting event tonight, a NASA-led event where real-time stream of data is visualized inside a large dome at the Swedish Visualizing Center in Norrköping.

Tonight I paid for the stay at the next Hab, **Habitat B**, that will be our home for next month, with a few quirks. There will be a gap between the current one and the next, some 3 days where we will be forced to find yet some other accommodation. A few days later we have to repeat the procedure because of the rooms are already booked by someone else, a total of 5 days on alternative accommodation. It's gonna be an extra cost and will exceed our budget slightly but Hab B will be close to daycare and public transportation.

We have not solved the puzzle with the alternative accommodation yet, but are looking into hotels and thinking package deal, 5 days split in two.



## Hab L, Day 29 (2015-08-29)

Today we visited the Thai festival at Strömsholmen in Eskilstuna, where the local Buddhist temple arranged the festivities. Food, beverages, candy and fruit. Lots of smiles. Met a few friends which I didn't knew they had Thai girlfriends or wifes, fun and such.

Last night in Eskilstuna, tomorrow we check out from **Habitat L**, with or without extra fees or restoration costs. After checkout we're going to Västerås, to **Habitat B**, to dump/store some of our bags and boxes, then transport to **Habitat X**, a hotel where we need to stay before our room becomes available at **Hab B** the 1st of September. The weekend 4 to 6 September we need to go back to **Hab X** to spend the weekend away from **Hab B**, as it was booked since before, everything is booked that weekend in Västerås, as there is some convention, conference or similar going on that weekend. After that weekend there is no deviations from the path towards our new home base **FLV5**.

Got a call from new owners of home base **B19**, we got mail so we're going to meet up tomorrow to get it.

So our last month living in a knapsack has been solved, accommodation-wise, as it looks right now. We busted the budget, exceeded the accommodation budget as we hadn't expected to stay at hotel, but costs are within reasonable boundaries.

Pinged land lord to get an idea about how and when he would show up tomorrow, to plan the events of tomorrow and when to exit Eskilstuna.



## Hab X, Day 30 (2015-08-30)

Yay! We left **Habitat L** this afternoon, without problems. We are officially part of the Västerås population.

Now we are at an alternative accommodation after spending the afternoon with my dad, our stuff dropped off at **Habitat B**. **Habitat X** is a hotel in central Västerås and I have less than 300 meter to the office.

Woke up well before 06 this morning, putting stuff in order and packing backpacks, bags and boxes. Went into to town far too early, stores didn't open until 12 and we had to wait, spent time waiting through a visit at McDonkeys to feed the son. Got the stuff and then went home. Met with land lord and returned the keys after a tour around the rooms to check for broken or missing things, nothing broken or missing besides the things we had reported as such, the shower wall, which they thought were installation error, tightened screws too much or something.



## Hab X, Day 31 (2015-08-31)

Back to work and first day as a Västerås city dweller, feels good and we are enjoying the city, but we are living in a smallish hotel room all three of us, son is not always happy with the cramped conditions. The room is pretty much a few square meters of naked floor, small couch (from where I writing this), a wall hung desk, a TV and two regular sized beds, son sleeps in a travel baby bed, we also have a nice large balcony with view of a central street below and the entrance of a shopping center across the street.

Tomorrow afternoon we can check in at **Habitat B**, where we can stay till Friday afternoon as it had been booked, we either go back to **Habitat X** or go to a yet unknown location to stay over the weekend, after the weekend we can move back to **Habitat B** and stay for the reminder of the month.

Tomorrow is also introduction day for our son at his new daycare center, it's located about 200 meters from our (future) Home Base **FLV5**. We both need to attend as it is introduction for us as well for the son, to get to know the staff and they get to know us.



## Hab B, Day 32 (2015-09-01)

At **Habitat B** now, son has been showered and put to bed. We are sharing a small house with another tenant, we have two rooms, one slightly larger than the other.

I think this will be good, but I still want to fast forward the month, so we can move in to our new apartment, home base **FLV5**.

Had introduction day at the daycare center this morning, son stepped into the crowd and started to play with the other kids, no hesitation. I'm sure he will be fine. The staff seems to be nice.

We're thinking about to hire a company to fetch and carry all our stuff to our apartment when it's time to move in - would be worth a lot to have it done for us, I was sore for several days after we moved all the stuff to storage. Then we had no stairs to traverse up and down, we do now.



## Hab B, Day 33 (2015-09-02)

Busy day at the office, met wife and son for lunch. Late afternoon I started scripting and lost track of time and left the office about 45 minutes late. Clocked my walk back to **Habitat B** from the bus stop, pretty much the same time as this morning, 12 - 15 minutes walk.

Followed up a tip we got from the broker, but as expected the accommodation were only available to friends and families of the condominium association members, but for 300 SEK/day it was worth following up. The search continues.

Son's first day of introduction at daycare center, only a few hours, came home completely pooped, drained of energy. I think he liked it, report from wife suggest that he had a blast, new surroundings and new friends.

As we don't have access to laundry facilities at **Habitat B**, we are looking for alternative accommodation, we might have found a workaround; using the laundry room in the house we are waiting to move into - ask the lady we bought the condo from if we could use the laundry room and yes, we can. The quirk is that one of us has to do laundry while the other stays with the son, entertaining and feeding him.



## Hab B, Day 34 (2015-09-03)

Zombie today. Slept beside son, he tosses and turns though the night.

Thinking about changing **Habitat B** for something else as it's cramped for space, kitchen access, access to laundry room. Alternative is not cheap, hotel room for 3 weeks.

We need to move out of **Habitat B** tomorrow afternoon, **Habitat X** over the weekend and then back into **Habitat B** Sunday afternoon. 

At the moment I have slight angst and if this move isn't giving me white hair there must be something wrong. The bank hasn't replied yet and today it's a month left to move in, I really hope there isn't any problems with financing or anything.

Soon time to go to bed.



## Hab X, Day 36 (2015-09-05)

In a hotel in town since yesterday evening, same hotel as before but in a different, smaller room. Last time, the room were one bigger room with a balcony towards one of the busy streets below, now we have windows facing the other direction, inwards to a yard or parking lot in between the houses.
Since we're not here for the view, I could as well have the windows removed and bricked up but I'm not alone in this - we spend most of the time out and away from the room anyway.
Today we went to Erikslund, a large shopping center area in the outskirts of Västerås, just browsed around, tried the food court and picked up small stuff and did the mandatory tour through IKEA.

Back at the hotel again we did some laundry.



## Hab B, Day 37 (2015-09-06)

Back at **Habitat B**, were welcomed by owner and tenant. On our way here we swung by a grocery store and got some necessities, food stuffs and diapers.

We totally missed out on gruel, last bottle were just served and one of us have to bicycle to a nearby store, as the evening feeding would be a scream fest without it. The same for tomorrow morning.

Checking out of **Habitat X** was a breeze, the not so fun part was to carry everything we brought for the weekend.



## Hab B, Day 38 (2015-09-07)

Busy day at office, felt feverish all day, hot, cold and slight nausea.

Went through the day anyway, feeling all weird, aching joints, feet and hips. Probably a prelude to getting sick.

**Habitat B** feels a bit like home now, getting used to the walk in the morning, the wonky bed and sleeping besides son.



## Hab B, Day 39 (2015-09-08)

Crazy busy day at work today, participated in TeamSkills events throughout the day, fun and interesting. Started preparing a virtual machine to work with another customer, struggled to get the damn thing to pull updates, 5 minutes before leaving I managed to get it going, then paused it to continue tomorrow.

Got reply from moving company along with a quotation for cost of moving our stuff about 4 kilometers and haul it up two flights of stairs. Nothing surprising, need to get a few quotations from other companies.



## Hab B, Day 40 (2015-09-09)

Busy day at the office.

Got yet another moving company reply today, they wanted to know more about the stuff, how many boxes, furniture and such, comes through as professional. The other two companies has not been heard from, think I already have an idea about which company to choose.

Have an appointment with bank about finalizing the loan and financing for the new apartment. Looking forward to it, to have everything in writing and get it done.

Son really enjoys the new daycare center, he has already picked up the routines.



## Hab B, Day 42 (2015-09-11)

The work week was crazy, lots to do and think about, drained when coming home in the evenings. I like it.

Still looking for moving companies, the remaining two companies that I sent a request for quotation has not responded back, at all. Gonna check with the lady we bought the apartment from, as she hired a company to move all her stuff and also clean the apartment, maybe they can offer us a good price and we don't need to synchronize with  with another moving company -- they could move our stuff in as soon as they were done cleaning... is my thoughts.

Tomorrow we're going across city to explore and evaluate the last Asian shop of many in town, wife has been through all of them, checking them out. One without price tagged items where the price is disclosed as items are being punched into the cash register, another where prices on items seem to have been multiplied with 1.5, 2 or 3 or as I expressed it when I heard about the price levels, "WTF?!". Otherwise they were stocked with were few items or were stocked with items from a single country, lack of diversity.



## Hab B, Day 43 (2015-09-12)

Today is my mothers birthday, on our way across town I called her to congratulate her and also congratulate both mom and dad on their 44th wedding anniversary.

Updated them on what and how we are going to handle the move, the bank and other stuff.

Across town we went to check out an Asian shop, to our surprise it was really good, wide assortment of known products and low to moderate prices. Had lunch and went on the shop for groceries and then found a low budget thingy store, left with fly swatters and hand wash detergent. Probably a return visit, to most of the places.

When thinking about it, I do not miss Eskilstuna, at all. Not on any plane, not the city. I miss friends.
As we have been living in Västerås for a few weeks, I have come to like the city more and more, sure it has it's quirks but so does all cities. One of our reactions just a few days into living in Västerås were "Why the fuck didn't we do this earlier?" and that still stands, should have moved earlier.




## Hab B, Day 44 (2015-09-13)

Yet another trip across town, today in another direction. Visited a few stores to check them out and got some groceries.

Have gotten used to living at the bed & breakfast, having to share the cramped space with another tenant, we can call her "M", we're getting along fine and this morning she took our son for a walk, wife were a bit jumpy and worried, of course nothing happened and they returned OK.



## Hab B, Day 45 (2015-09-14)

At work I started to dig into a new technical area today, the idea is to take some load off one of our teams by teaching myself parts of a platform were most of the team members lack in knowledge.

Haven't given the move much thought, but need to get a quotation from yet another moving company the have something to compare between. The lady we bought the apartment from have contracted a company to have her stuff moved, thinking that if they are moving her stuff they could move ours as well. But first things first, a quotation.

Colleagues are asking about the move, have we moved in and so on. Answering that we are living at a B&B and are just waiting for the month to pass.



## Hab B, Day 46 (2015-09-15)

This morning I met with our seller, the lady we bought the apartment from, to fetch laundry room key and some mail. She drove me down town and we talk about moving in and out from our separate perspectives, she can't get into her new apartment because the elderly couple she bought her apartment from were slow about moving out and into their new apartment, there was something about some walk in closet to be built before they could move in and such. I told her about our plan to hire a company to move our stuff in as soon as her stuff is moved out and the apartment has been cleaned properly, we would just need the bed to be in place and assembled to sleep in our new apartment the first night.

The other stuff we could unpack and arrange during several weeks .. or days, whichever comes first. Our 40-ish boxes and assorted stuff won't take that long to unpack.

A bank employee called today, to arrange a meeting .. the thing is that they called last week to arrange a meeting. When I told that I already had an an appointment the phone call went sideways, the person started talk with colleagues and came back to the call briefly, said goodbye and forgot to hang up, still talking about the confusing situation.

Emailed yet another moving company yesterday, still waiting for a reply .. or reaction. As the quotation form on their homepage didn't fit my needs, it didn't have any options for entering storage as origin or describing items or amount of boxes. At the moment we only got one quotation, at a somewhat fair rate.



## Hab B, Day 48 (2015-09-17)

Crazy at work today. Woke up at 04:10 as son decided it was a good idea to kick his dad in the face, managed to get him to sleep again, did not fall asleep myself until much later, was awaken by son again just before 06, went up and went to work. Was on call from 06, first interaction came about 08 and from there it was full on crazy. Got home at 19:30-ish, so quite a long day.

Hopefully tomorrow isn't gonna be equally busy, but experience says it is going to keep on until at least lunch.



## Hab B, Day 50 (2015-09-19)

Spent most of the day criss crossing town, farmers market like fair on the square and shopping to groceries in the local middle eastern shop. Tried a new restaurant and were positively surprised, it's close to the office so there might be return visits just based on the pasta-beef dish I ate today.

Yesterday was a bit calmer at the office, thursday was busy busy as there was more or less chaos and I had to work overtime to solve a problem, resending messages that got messed up, left the office after 7 in the evening.

Tomorrow they are gonna shut down the road outside at 09, so we need to leave before that, some kind of bicycle race or similar. It's gonna be closed to 16 so we need to keep ourselves busy until then. The mission is to get across town, to a neighborhood we haven't been to yet, to buy some stuff for the son and then back to town. After that we have nothing planned.

Also, the broker have indicated that our seller is possibly moving out earlier, nothing we have heard directly from her, but that revokes pretty much all previous planning about the moving day. New round of planning and trying to get the schedule to fit without overlap or gaps.



## Hab B, Day 51 (2015-09-20)

Bicycle race started at 09, we left the house at 09:15 and managed to get past the road block, went to baby stuff flea market in a part of town we hadn't been to before, on our way to the next way point, I discovered that our son had a tick on his forehead, went to find a pharmacy and a tick-picker and found one, continued on to way point to pick up a autumn/winter cover all for son. Went back into town and took a walk, a quite long walk. All in all we walked for 2 hours and 43 minutes, almost 10 kilometers and 16194 steps, so we are a bit sore.




## Hab B, Day 53 (2015-09-22)

There is some movement in the planning of moving into the apartment; seller has stated to move out and clean the 25th September, broker is very eager to finalize and close the deal with payment.

I have an appointment with the bank on the 28th.

Trying to reach out to the bank to reschedule the appointment to this week, if successful we might move in Friday 25th or some day next week, as we are going to use a moving company I need a firm date to plan around, at the moment everything is sliding towards next week.

Feeling stressed, squashed between the wish and strive to move in and the knowledge that the bank could delay the whole moving machinery til next week.



## Hab B, Day 55 (2015-09-24)

Today we signed all the papers.

We finalized the papers with the broker and as soon the seller has signed, the papers are going to the bank for processing, settling the deal.

At the bank we signed yet more paperwork to finalize the loan, prepare everything for tomorrow, when the signed contract arrives.

In the end, we are going to get the keys to our new apartment at earliest tomorrow evening or Saturday, when the seller has moved out and the apartment has been cleaned.

Talked to parents and invited them to come and check out the apartment after we have moved in, that would be anytime after Monday lunch, as that was the the first possible slot we could get with the moving company. Stuff stored at parents place could be moved as soon as next weekend, servers, bicycles and pram among things.

Our Internet's will be up and running from day one as we arranged with the ISP to have it connected as soon as previous habitant is disconnected. We even have the intarwebs router waiting on location, since we visited earlier in the summer.

It's gonna be nice to have our own space again, living in a knapsack since beginning of August in 4 different locations, shelling out something in the neighborhood of 20000 SEK for just housing and accommodation, other costs increased as well because of not being able to cook and freeze or even stuff ingredients into freezer.

We iz happsy!



## Hab B, Day 57 (2015-09-26)

Today we got the keys!

We took a moment to look around and get a feel for the apartment, went across town for IKEA, spent about 2 hours touring IKEA for this-and-that, mostly looking at stuff, inspiration. Escaped with only 1200 on the receipt, which could be considered pretty low.

Went back to the apartment to dump the stuff, have another look, replaced a dead light bulb (actually a low energy spiral bulb) with a LED dito. We needed to eat something so we went o a nearby center and had pizza and kebab, the son ate pasta carbonara. Copied post box key.



## Home base FLV5, Day 58 (2015-09-28)

Touch down!
Today we moved in. The moving company called just before 11 when I was at work and I went down to the entrance to meet them, hand over keys and instructions. I left the office at about 12, met with wife in the apartment and the went to fetch our last remaining items from **Habitat B**. Got there and gathered our stuff, with help from our cohabitant we got the stuff transported to the apartment.

Out of about 40 boxes, we have killed about 8 this far, beds and kitchen table assembled and temporary light fixtures are up.

Unpacking after two months is a bit like Christmas, open a box and find stuff you need, that was almost forgotten.

Noticed lots of small stuff missing, started lists of things to get.

Long day, woke up at **Habitat B**, went to work, go to Home Base **FLV5**, go to **Habitat B** and back, unpack and shuffle things around. Now in bed, sore feet but happy, we have landed.



## The long journey is over (2015-09-30)

We have landed, moved in and have started to build and form our new home. Some furniture is scattered around the apartment as we had to ditch and throw most of what we had due to time and space constraints when evacuating the house in end of July. We have a few essential items though, beds for everyone, kitchen table, two bookshelves and a desk, some cooking equipment but no plates or deep dishes, which makes meals a bit of an adventure.

I've just shared a long list of items to look for and get for the apartment, things like vacuum cleaner, rugs, cleaning equipment and light armatures. When we moved in, the previous owner had taken down and brought with them all but one ceiling electrical box lids with connectors, been through a few stores looking for this type of lid, hearing that they stopped carrying this particular type a few years ago, I've seen the correct type, I held it, sniffed it but could not justify 175 SEK each for myself, similar lids though not exactly like the one I'm looking for is about 35 SEK.

It feels so good to know that we are going to stay, that we don't need to pack everything up and move to yet a temporary accommodation, we are done with that part. I heard someone say that a hotel stay would be fun and nice, I'm f'ing bored with it, the only positive with staying at a hotel is clean towels whenever you want and perhaps no-effort breakfasts, all served. But still, boring.

Now, sitting at the kitchen table, looking around, listening, can't hear any neighbors, no sounds from the yard between the houses, just the low hum of the ventilation system. Thinking about the last two months, the struggle, how we kept ourselves sane by thinking ahead of what would come, how to juggle everything and make the pieces fit in our puzzle. The biggest scare was when the shower wall broke and I saw for my inner self that the land lord would charge us a hefty amount for it and felt really bad, it could have shot down our budget completely, but instead they trusted us and thought it might have been installed incorrectly. Another moment was when I helped M come to terms with her computer, gave her a few nifty tips on how to do stuff and helped restore and backup "lost" pictures, she was really happy when she understood that her pictures from her computer were accessible in her phone and all pictures she shoot will be saved online, even told her that she could lose both computer and phone and the pictures would still be safe.

The journey was long but we came home, a new home.
